# Implement operations to modify ontology:

&dlC[onto,delta,ID,Class](Instance)

onto:     CONSTANT ontology meta info string
delta:    PREDICATE a set of ontology modifications
ID:       CONSTANT selects one ontology modification
Concept:  CONSTANT which concept to query
Instance: CONSTANT instances which are classified as Class in onto modified by delta[ID]

Modifications are represented as operations in delta(ID,<operation>).

Possible operations:

* addc(Class,Instance)            assert Class(Instance)
* addop(Role,Instance1,Instance2) assert ObjectProperty(Instance1,Instance2)
* adddp(Datarole,Instance,Data)   assert DataProperty(Instance,Data)
* delc(.), delop(.), deldp(.)     retract . (arguments as above)

# Smaller TODOs

* move plugin to package hexlite.plugin.owlapi
* change HashSet to Set in interfaces, ArrayList to List, etc.
  add ? extends and ? super where necessary (Producer Extends Consumer Super)
